    Sherbend is a geospatial simplification and generalization tool for lines and polygons. \
    Sherbend is an implementation and an improvement of the algorithm described in the paper \
    "Line Generalization Based on Analysis of Shape Characteristics, Zeshen Wang and \
    Jean-Claude MÃ¼ller, 1998" often known as "Bend Simplify" or "Wang Algorithm". The \
    particularity of this algorithm is that for each line it analyzes its bends (curves) and \
    decides which one to simplify, trying to emulate what a cartographer would do manually \
    to simplify or generalize a line. Sherbend will accept points, lines and polygons as input. \
    Even though points cannot be simplified, they are used for topological relationship \
    validations. Sherbend can accept GeoPackage and Esri Shape file as input/ouput but not a mixed \
    of both.

    <b>Usage</b>

    <u>Input</u> : Any Line string or Polygon layer

    <u>Bend diameter</u>: Theoritical diameter of a bend to remove

    <u>Exclude hole</u>: If you want to exclude holes below the diameter of the bend

    <u>Exclude polygon</u>: If you want to exclude polygon below the diameter of the bend

    <u>Bend diameter</u>: Theoretical diameter of a bend to remove

    <b>Line Simplification versus Line Generalization</b>
    Line Simplification is the process of removing vertices in a line while trying to keep the maximum \
    number of details within the line whereas Line Generalization is the process of removing \
    meaningless (unwanted) details in a line usually for scaling down. The well known Douglas-Peucker \
    algorithm is a very good example of line simplification tool and Sherbend falls more in the \
    category of line generalization tools. Keep in mind thay both algorithms can be complementary because \
    Sherbend will not remove unnecessary vertices in the case of very high densities of vertices. It may \
    be a good idea to use Douglass Peucker before Sherbend in the case of very densed geometries.

    <b>Rule of thumb for the diameter</b>
    Sherbend can be used for line simplifying often in the context of line generalization. The big \
    question will often be what diameter should we use? A good starting point is the cartographic rule of \
    thumb -- the .5mm on the map -- which says that the minimumm distance between two lines should be \
    greater than 0.5mm on a paper map. So to simplify (generalize) a line for representation at a scale of \
    1:50 000 for example a diameter of 25m should be a good starting point...Rule of thumb for the diameter \
